  <h2 style="font-size: 1.5em;">What is Malaria?</h2>
  <p class="center" style="text-indent: 20px; color: #555;">
    Malaria is a disease that has the highest fatality rate in children. In 2022, there were 249 million malaria cases globally that led to 608,000 deaths in total. Of these deaths, 76 per cent were children under 5 years of age. That means that 462,080 children died from malaria in 2022.

  <h2>Our Design</h2>
  <p class="center" style="text-indent: 20px; color: #555;">For our design, we used one A large, one A small, one B small, and one A small. This gave us pretty good results. It has 9% of high resistance to drug A, 17% of high resistance to drug B, and 0% of high resistance to drug C. These results are pretty good, all below 20%. For our other results, we had no change for the total parasite population, which isn't optimal, but still fairly good. We also have a cost of $2,800, which, again, isn't optimal, but is fine. Lastly, we had a side effect of mild, which is pretty good. Below is the image of our design.</p>
